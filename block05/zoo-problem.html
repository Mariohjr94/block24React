          Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (/ˈɜːrsɪdiː,
          -daɪ/). They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.
          Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread,
          appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the
          Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere.

        <h3>Giraffes</h3>

          The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
          Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
          ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one
          species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
          researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due
          to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as
          morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are
          known from the fossil record.

          The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to
          Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short,
          rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It
          is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and
          have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
          prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females,
          and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly
          on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
          although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been
          known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
          prey on humans.

        <h3>Monkeys</h3>

          Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
          infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all
          animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
          except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic
          grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes
          (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians
          synonyms in regard to their scope.

          An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the
          Crocodilia order in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae.
          The two extant species are the American alligator (A.
          mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis).
          Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from
          fossil remains. Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene epoch
          about 37 million years ago.
